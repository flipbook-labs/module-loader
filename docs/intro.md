# Getting Started

The first thing to do when getting started is to install the package.

## Installation

Installing the package is quick and easy whether you use a package manager like [Wally](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally) or work directly in Studio.

### Wally (Recommended)

Add the following to your `wally.toml` and run `wally install` to download the package.

```toml
[dependencies]
ModuleLoader = "vocksel/module-loader@0.2.0"
```

Make sure the resulting `Packages` folder is synced into your experience using a tool like [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/).

### Roblox Studio

* Download a copy of the rbxm from the [releases page](https://github.com/vocksel/module-loader/releases/latest) under the Assets section.
* Drag and drop the file into Roblox Studio to add it to your experience.

## Next Steps

Check out the [API reference](/api) for everything that the package exposes.
